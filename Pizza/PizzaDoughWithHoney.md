Pizza dough 
==========
INGREDIENTS
-------------------

+ 3 1/2 cups flour
+ 1 cup warm water
+ 2 tablespoons yeast
+ 2 tablespoons honey
+ 1/4 cup olive oil
+ 1/2 teaspoon salt

TO MIX PIZZA DOUGH BY HAND:
--------------------------------------------

- Pour 1 cup warm water into a bowl. The water should be about 85 to 115Â° F.  
  Test it with your hand. It should feel very warm, but comfortable. 
- Add the 2 tablespoons honey and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix by and hand (or any other method) until well blended. 
- Add the 2 tablespoons yeast and mix some more. Let this mixture sit for about 5 minutes.
- Add 1 cup of flour and the 1/4 cup olive oil and mix until well blended.
- Add the rest of the 2 1/2 cups flour (and any other additions) and mix well. The dough should turn into a ball. 
  If the dough does not ball up because it's too dry, add water one tablespoon at a time until it does. If your 
  mixture is more like a batter, add flour one tablespoon at a time. Adding water or flour as needed to get the 
  right consistency will assure you always get a perfect dough. Just remember to do it in small amounts.
- Once the dough is balled up, place the ball on a floured board and knead for about a minute. This builds the 
  gluten which helps the dough to rise and become fluffy when cooked. Place the dough in a covered bowl and store 
  in a warm, dry area to rise.
- After about 45 minutes the dough should have about doubled in size. Punch it down.  Give it a good smack so 
  it deflates. Let it rise for another hour to an hour and a half. The dough is now ready to be rolled out. 
  You can punch the dough down one more time if you want and wait another hour or two before rolling out, 
  if you want to.
- Take over from here to add your topings and cook your pizza.
