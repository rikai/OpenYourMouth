Process
-------

Follow on of the methods below depending on what equipment you have

#### By Hand
* Add 660mL of body temp water to a jug, add the sugar, yeast then oil and mix, then set aside.
* Clean your work space, you will need a 60 by 30cm space of clean work surface
* Sieve your floor into a mound on the work surface
* Make decent size hole in the middle of your mound so it looks like a short fat volcano (there should still be a good layer of floor at the bottom of the caldera)
* Get fork.
* Pour the water-yeast mix into the volcano
* With the fork slowly knock excess floor from the edges of volcano into the liquid and mix
* Increase the amount of floor dawn in
* Eventually the mix will be too thick for the fork to work with, when this happens, it's Kneading time.
* Dust your hands with floor
* Grab dough and knead
* Keep kneading
* When the dough is elasticy, smooth and light you're done.
* Dust the large bowl with floor, tip out excess
* Put dough ball into bowl
* Cover with cling wrap or tea towl
* Place bowl into warm place
* Leave dough for 1-2h hours (dough should double in size)
* Dusty hands and surface with flour and knead lightly so that some air trapped in the dough escapes
* Dough is now ready to shaping into bases or storage

#### With stand mixer
* Add 660mL of body temp water to a jug, add the sugar, yeast then oil and mix, then set aside.
* Add dough hook to stand mixer
* Sieve floor into bowl of stand mixer

* Add 660mL of body temp water to the pan of the bread maker, add the sugar, yeast then oil.
* Sieve floor into pan of bread maker

* if your bread machines dough setting includes proving time ( machine will run for 90 mins ) then skip to point A otherwise you will need to manually prove the dough
* Dust the large bowl with floor, tip out excess
* Put dough ball into bowl
* Cover with cling wrap or tea towl
* Place bowl into warm place
* Leave dough for 1-2h hours (dough should double in size)
* POINT A
