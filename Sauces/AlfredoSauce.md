# Alfredo Sauce

## Ingredients

- 1 pint heavy cream
- 5 oz Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, shredded
- 1 Tbsp butter
- 1 Tsp minced garlic
- 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- Black pepper (to taste)
- Freshly grated nutmeg (to taste)

## Directions

In a medium sauce pan, over medium-high heat, melt butter and add in minced
garlic. Cook garlic until golden and add in flour and whisk slowly for 30
seconds.

Add heavy cream and whisk until flour and butter are blended in. Stir regularly
until cream warms until it's just above too hot to touch. Try not to let the
cream boil, as this can lead to off flavors. Reduce head or remove pan from heat
as needed to maintain heat. Once it's just above too hot to touch, start adding
shredded cheese in small batches, approximately 1/4 cup or less at a time. Whisk
in each batch until incorporated before adding next batch. Continue whisking until
all the cheese is incorporated and melted, and sauce is smooth.

Remove sauce from heat. At black pepper to taste, and a small amount of freshly
grated nutmeg, no more than 1/8 Tsp.
