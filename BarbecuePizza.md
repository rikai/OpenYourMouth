30-Minute Barbecue Chicken Pizza

1 (12-inch)
Prep Time: 15 min 
Cook Time: 12 min  


Ingredients:  

1 pound store-bought or homemade pizza dough
Cornmeal, for dusting baking sheet
1/2 cup barbecue sauce
1 cup diced rotisserie or grilled chicken
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/3 cup thinly sliced red onions
1/4 cup diced pineapples

Directions:

Preheat the oven to 500°F.

Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface until it is roughly 12 inches wide and 1/4-inch thick.

Invert a baking sheet and sprinkle it liberally with cornmeal. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet.

In a medium bowl, toss together the diced chicken with half (1/4 cup) of the barbecue sauce. Spread the remaining 1/4 cup barbecue sauce on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. 

Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese atop the barbecue sauce, and then evenly distribute the coated chicken atop the cheese. Scatter the red onions and pineapples atop the chicken.

Bake the pizza for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating it half-way through, until the crust is fully baked and golden brown. Remove the pizza from the oven to a cutting board, then slice and serve.
