## Instructions

1. Cut the onion into small pieces and fry them in a pen till they are translucent.
2. Put the kidney beans along with the garlic(pressed), the onion, the carrot(grated) 
   and all the other ingredients in a bowl.
3. Squash the mass using either a masher or a blender. It is good to have a few larger pieces remaining.
