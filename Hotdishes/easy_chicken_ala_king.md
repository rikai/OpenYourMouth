## Description

This dish is an easy way to use up cooked chicken or you can grab a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. Serve over rice, egg noodles or, like my mom used to do, dress it up with these: [Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Shells](http://www.pepperidgefarm.com/Images/Products/prdLarge_112172.jpg).


## Ingredients

* 2 cups cooked chicken, diced
* 1 1/2 cups frozen mixed vegetables
* 4 TBSP butter
* 4 TBSP AP flour
* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
* salt and pepper, to taste
* 1/8 TSP grated nutmeg
* a couple of dashes of hot sauce (optional)


## Procedure

1. in a saucepan or straight-sided skillet, melt the butter over medium heat
2. add the nutmeg and the AP flour, stir gently to combine and cook until smooth and bubbly
3. whisk in the chicken broth, making sure to get rid of all lumps
4. remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the milk, return to heat and bring to a boil
5. cook sauce for 1 min, stirring constantly
6. add the chicken and the vegetables, cook over medium heat until hot
7. season to taste with the salt and pepper
