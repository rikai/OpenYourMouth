by: Tomracing79

## Ingredients

- risotto rice
- 6 stalks of celery
- 1 white onion
- 3 cloves of garlic
- Mushrooms about 300gram, oyster mushrooms and chestnut mushrooms do well
- parmasan cheese
- vegetable stock enough for 1.5Litres
- olive oil
- thyme
- parsley
- vermouth/martini or white wine
- butter

## Steps

1. Slicing and dicing: cut the onion and the celery stalks into even small cubes. Meanwhile boil water to make your 1.5L vegetable stock. And brush clean your mushroom without slicing them. Preheat the oven at 180degC.
2. Put the sliced onion and celery in a wok or large and deep frying pan with some olive oil and press the garlic cloves in. Stir and fry slowly for 15minutes without colouring.
3. Add about 200gram of risotto rice to the vegetables and turn up the heat to full. fry for 1min to let the risotto turn clear slightly. carefully add 1 glass of the vermouth and stir through the risotto.
4. Once the vermouth has fully evaporated add two ladels of vegetable stock and turn down the heat to a level where it slow boils. Keep stirring the ristotto regularly and add new vegetable stock once the previous amount evaporated. This process will take about 15 to 25minutes depending a bit on your type of risotto rice. Start tasting around the 20minute mark.
5. Fry the mushrooms in a frying pan with a generous amount of olive oil and a nice know of butter until the start turning that nice light brown shiny colour. Sprinkle on some thyme, transfer the mushroom to an oven dish and put them in the oven for about 8-12 minutes.
6. Keep stirring that risotto and regularly add stock. If you run out of stock before hand boil some water and add water instead. prepare a good two handsfull of grated parmasan cheese for when the risotto is ready.
7. Get the mushrooms from the oven and slice up 75% of them finely, The other part cut coarsly as decoration.
8. When the Risotto is done add the finely cut mushrooms, some finely sliced parsley, a few small knobs of butter and the parmasan cheese. Stir everything through the risotto then put the lid on and take the pan of the fire. let sit for 2minutes before serving.
9. Dish up the risotto and cover with the coarse mushrooms. add a stalk of parsley as decoration and enjoy!
