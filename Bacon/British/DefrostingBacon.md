2. Place the bacon on a microwavable plate
3. Place the plate (with the bacon on) into the microwave
4. Microwave bacon repeat (4) until defrosted
	- Low power!
	- Short bursts (30 seconds)
	- Check bacon after each cycle
5. Do something with your bacon

### Hot water

1. Is the bacon in packaging
	- (yes) Remove packaging
	- (no) Continue
2. Heat some water
	- Not to boiling!
3. Put hot water it in a bowl
	- Be very careful!

4. Put your bacon in the bowl
