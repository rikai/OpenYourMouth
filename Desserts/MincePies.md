## Ingredients

- 8 oz butter, softened
- 1 lb all-purpose flour 
- 2 oz powdered sugar 
- 2 egg yolks 
- 1 lb mincemeat 
- 1-2 oz of brandy or rum - if desired 
- 1 Beaten egg, to glaze 

## Hardware

- Muffin tins to make 30 pies

## Directions

Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.

Cut the butter into cubes. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl. Add the butter
and, using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles
fine breadcrumbs. 

Stir in the powdered sugar. 

Make a well in the center, stir in the egg yolk and about 3-4 tbsp iced water
o make a soft but not sticky dough. Knead lightly to form a smooth dough, and
then chill dough for 30 minutes.

Grease the muffin tins with butter so that the inside of each cup is well 
covered.

On a floured surface, roll out two thirds of the dough and cut out 30 rounds
using a 2-inch fluted cutter. Place each round in the muffin tins. Fill with
mincemeat. If desired, mix some of the brandy or rum, to taste, into the mincemeat.
Mixture will be a little looser. Re-roll remaining pastry and trimmings and cut
out circles using a 2 inch cutter. Dampen edges of circle and place on top of
pies. Seal edges, brush tops with beaten egg and cook for 20 minutes.
