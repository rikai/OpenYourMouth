### Add the rest. 
* 150g butter (melted)

>Melt the butter in the microwave, that takes less time. 

### Bake it!
Put your dough in a cup, on a plate, in a shoe. it doesn't matter. 
cook it for as long as you want. but it finishes FAST, so keep you're eye on it. 
also the dough puffs up to about twice the size when cooked.
