# Pork Green Chili (makes aprox 1 gal)

## Ingredients:
* Pork Shoulder Roast (aka pork butt), 2-4 lbs, bone-in
* 2 anaheim chilies
* 2 poblano chilies
* 1 jalapeno chilie (optional, spicy)
* one small white onion, diced
* 3-4 cloves garlic, crushed/minced/smashed up
* 3 qt low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth
* 12oz beers (corona, tecate, bud, etc... not light beer) (one for the chili, many for the cook!)
* 2-3 Tbsp mexican oregano, dried
* 5-7 red potatoes, quartered or one large can of white hominy, drained
* coarse ground salt and pepper
* ground cumin or prepared chili powder
* cayenne pepper (optional)


## Procedure 1 (slow and good):

1. Let pork shoulder come to room temperature; rub shoulder with olive oil and sprinkle on all sides with coarse ground salt, pepper, and mexican oregano (if you can't find mexican oregano in your local store, skip it, DO NOT SUBSTITUTE sweet, italian oregano) Roast pork at 300 degrees F in the center of the oven until it reaches an internal temperature of 200 - 210 degrees F. (at this point, the bone should be lose and pull out easily from the meat)

2. Meanwhile, chop the chilies. (removing the veins and seeds will reduce the heat, however the anaheim and poblano chilies are not very spicy to begin with. If you are concerned, taste a small piece of the raw chilie before you cook it.) 

3. In a 6qt or larger soup or stock pot, saute the chilies and onion in a Tbsp of olive oil or vegetable oil until they are soft. Add the garlic and saute for 1-2 min more. Be sure to keep stirring so the garlic doesn't burn. Add the broth and remove from the heat.

4. When the pork is done in the oven, transfer it to a large metal or glass bowl and shred it with two forks; stir it into the broth and vegetable mixture and return to the heat. Add 12 oz beer and quartered potatoes (or hominy) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender; adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, cumin (or chili powder), cayanne.


## Procedure 2 (slow and easy and good... ie, the at-home dad way)

Place first 9 ingredents in a large crock pot (if your crock pot isn't big enough, adjust recipe or buy a bigger crock pot :-) ; cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 8 hours; add potatoes/hominy in last half hour of cooking; season to taste
