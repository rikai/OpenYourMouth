#Black Bean 'n Pork Rib Chili
##Description
*I've only made this recipe a couple of times, but I really like it, not only eating it, but making it too. I have to admit, I don't especially go in for specific ingredient lists when it comes to chilis and soups. I'm not making a Béarnaise here. Predictably, the results can be a bit hit-or-miss. YMMV. For what it's worth, this recipe, more or less, won the 'Most Original Recipe' award at the 2009 South & Associates, PC Chili Cookoff. Perhaps not the most prestigious award I grant, but I had fun with it.*

|Optional ingredients I have tried | US                | Comments                                                                      |

| beer                             | 1 bottle          | Nothing heavier than an amber. I prefer drinking the beer with the chili. ;-) |
| molasses                         | 1 tablespoon, max | Go lightly! A little goes a long way.                                         |
| rice                             | 1/4 cup, max      | It adds body, but ultimately, I didn't like it.                               |
| liquid smoke                     | 1 teaspoon (?)    | Ugh. No. Again, your mileage may vary                                         |
| Barbecue sauce                   | 1/2 cup           | My preference is spicy over sweet. I'm from Kansas City and they take that stuff *very* seriously here. |

##Preparation
1. Prepare ribs. I slow cook them in a crock pot for a while until the meat falls off the bones. I don't usually marinate them - I just want the meat cooked. Separate the meat from the bones and set aside. I usually like to pull the pork so it's shredded instead of being chopped chunks of meat in the chili.
2. Put tomatoes and pork in a soup pot and start warming them up over low heat. I like to let chili warm up slowly to give the flavours a chance to mix.
3. Add chili power, cumin, black & red pepper. Spicing can be a contentious issue. I don't get too fancy with it, but everyone has their own take. My amounts are strictly ball-park. My hunch is that I actually use more than I've shown here.
4. Add meat to chili and mix in.
5. Saute onions lightly in olive oil. I like to stop while they're still a little crispy and have some flavour. Add to chili.
6. If you're using fresh (i.e. not canned) mushrooms, saute them lightly in the same pan. Add to chili.
7. Add green peppers. I try to leave it until later since I don't like mushy peppers in my chili. That can't always be avoided, but I try.
