#Black Bean 'n Pork Rib Chili

*I have to admit, I don't especially go in for specific ingredient lists when it comes to chilis and soups. I'm not making a BÃ©arnaise here. Predictably, the results can be a bit hit-or-miss. YMMV. For what it's worth, this recipe, more or less, won the 'Most Original Recipe' award at the 2009 South & Associates, PC Chili Cookoff. Perhaps not the most prestigious award I grant, but I had fun with it.*

##Ingredients
* 3 lb. 'Family Pack' pork ribs (bit of a guess - the more the better)
* 2 c. black beans, soaked or canned
* 3 c. crushed tomatoes, canned for convenience
* 1/2 c. mushroom pieces
* 2 - 3 cloves crushed garlic
* 1 c. chopped onion
* 1 c. green peppers in large pieces
* 3 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)
* cilantro to taste (optional)

###Optional ingredients I have tried
* 1 bottle of beer, usually nothing heavier than an amber. I prefer drinking the beer with the chili.
* molasses - Go lightly! A little goes a long way.
* 1/4 c. (maybe?) rice - It adds body, but ultimately, I didn't like it.
* liquid smoke - ugh. No.

##Directions
1. Prepare ribs. I slow cook them in a crock pot for a while until the meat falls off the bones. I don't usually marinate them - I just want the meat cooked. Separate the meat from the bones and set aside.
2. Put tomatoes and pork in a soup pot and start warming them up over low heat. I like to let chili warm up slowly to give the flavours a chance to mix.
3. Add chili power, cumin, black & red pepper. Spicing can be a contentious issue. I don't get too fancy with it, but everyone has their own take. My amounts are strictly ball-park. My hunch is that I actually use more than I've shown here.
4. Saute onions lightly in olive oil. I like to stop while they're still a little crispy and have some flavour.
