#Black Bean 'n Pork Rib Chili

*I have to admit, I don't especially go in for specific ingredient lists when it comes to chilis and soups. I'm not making a BÃ©arnaise here. Predictably, the results can be a bit hit-or-miss. YMMV. For what it's worth, this recipe, more or less, won the 'Most Original Recipe' award at the 2009 South & Associates, PC Chili Cookoff. Perhaps not the most prestigious award I grant, but I had fun with it.*

##Ingredients
* 3 lb. 'Family Pack' pork ribs (bit of a guess - the more the better)
* 2 c. black beans, soaked or canned
* 3 - 4 c. crushed tomatoes, canned for convenience
* 1/2 c. mushroom pieces
* 2 - 3 cloves crushed garlic
* 1 c. chopped onion
* 1 c. green peppers in large pieces
* 3 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)
* cilantro to taste (optional)

###Optional ingredients I have tried
* 1 bottle of beer, usually nothing heavier than an amber. I prefer drinking the beer with the chili.
* molasses - Go lightly! A little goes a long way.
* 1/4 c. (maybe?) rice - It adds body, but ultimately, I didn't like it.
* liquid smoke - ugh. No.

##Directions
1. Prepare ribs. I slow cook them in a crock pot for a while until the meat falls off the bones. I don't usually marinate them - I just want the meat cooked. Separate the meat from the bones and set aside.
2. Put tomatoes and pork in a soup pot and start warming them up over low heat. I like to let chili warm up slowly to give the flavours a chance to mix.
3. Add chili power, cumin, black & red pepper. Spicing can be a contentious issue. I don't get too fancy with it, but everyone has their own take. My amounts are strictly ball-park. My hunch is that I actually use more than I've shown here.
4. Saute onions lightly in olive oil. I like to stop while they're still a little crispy and have some flavour. Add to chili.
5. If you're using fresh (i.e. not canned) mushrooms, saute them lightly in the same pan. Add to chili.
6. Add green peppers. I try to leave it until later since I don't like mushy peppers in my chili. That can't always be avoided, but I try.

##Comments
I don't know how much this makes. How many it serves depends on how hungry people are. :-) I try to get most of the "cooking" out of the way before adding the peppers and mushrooms, since they don't add a lot of flavour to the chili and peppers tend to get mashed/mushrooms tend to get rubbery if cooked too long.

As I mentioned, spicing is a personal thing. I used to like chili really hot, but I've mellowed on that point. Now, I prefer to get some flavour. I'm not opposed to heat, even a lot of it, but if I can't discern a decent flavour, then the heat is wasted.
