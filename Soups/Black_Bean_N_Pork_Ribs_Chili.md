#Black Bean 'n Pork Rib Chili

*I have to admit, I don't especially go in for specific ingredient lists when it comes to chilis and soups. I'm not making a BÃ©arnaise here. Predictably, the results can be a bit hit-or-miss. YMMV. For what it's worth, this recipe, more or less, won the 'Most Original Recipe' award at the 2009 South & Associates, PC Chili Cookoff. Perhaps not the most prestigious award I grant, but I had fun with it.*

##Ingredients
* 3 lb. 'Family Pack' pork ribs (bit of a guess - the more the better)
* 2 c. black beans, soaked or canned
* 3 c. crushed tomatoes, canned for convenience
* 1/2 c. mushroom pieces
* 2 - 3 cloves crushed garlic
* 1 c. chopped onion
* 3 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)
