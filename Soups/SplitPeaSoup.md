# Split Pea Soup (makes aprox. 1 gal)

## Ingredients:

* 2 medium carrots, chopped (about a cup)
* 1 medium white onion, chopped (about a cup)
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed or minced
* 24oz oz dried split peas  *see notes

* smoked meat on a bone, aproximately 1 lb  *see notes 
* 1-2 Tbsp each dried sage and dried parsley
* coarse ground salt/pepper to taste
* olive oil or vegitable oil



## Notes:
on the split peas: these are usually available as green or yellow, i usually get one of each, but you may do as you wish
on the smoked meat: typically this will be a smoked pork hock or neck, however smoked turkey legs are mighty tasty, too



## Instructions:

1. heat 2 Tbsp of the olive or vegetable oil in your soup pot or dutch oven over med-high heat.
2. add the onions and carrots along with a heavy pinch of salt and pepper. 
3. saute lightly, stirring often, until carrots begin to soften (about 5-6 min)
4. add the garlic and stir for 1 minute (keep stirring or garlic will burn)
5. reduce heat to medium and add in the dried peas; stir to mix with the carrots/onion/garlic
6. stir in the broth
7. bring soup to a boil then reduce heat to low add the smoked meat, and put a lid on the pot
8. simmer for 45 min to 2 hours or longer. the soup will begin to thicken as the peas soften
9. pull out the smoked meat (ham hock, neck bone, turkey drumstick, etc) chop and return it to the pot
10. stir and enjoy

In my house growing up, this soup was always served with a dash of dry white wine and a dollop of sour cream. these are just suggestions!
