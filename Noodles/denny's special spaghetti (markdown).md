**Denny's Special Spaghetti :)**
  **Ingedients**
 
  This is my spaghetti recipe that I personally use when I cook, it's pretty yummy in my opinion and I hope you guys love it too :) let me know what you think.
 
*   Spaghetti Obviosly (preferably thick which is my preference but you can use something like angel hair if you like)
*   Olive Oil
*   butter
*   tomato sauce
*   sauseges (preferably a long stick to cut up like a summer sausuge)
*   onions
*   bell peppers
*   garlic cloves
*   seasoning salt
*   pepper
*   parsley
*   oregenal

  **Directions**
 
1.  Throw hot water on stove filling about 3/4 of a small pot, half of a big one (I ususally have the stove at a mediumish setting)
2.  pour some olive oil (about half a cup) in the pot of water
3.  while waiting for the water is boiling start up a hot frying pan and spread some butter on it so nothing sticks (I also use medium heat for this too)
4.  thinly slice up some sausage along with some diced bell peppers, onions and garlic, mix them and throw it on the frying pan
5.  When done cutting your meat and vegies water should be boiling so now throw some spaghetti into the pot of boling water
6.  stir the spaghetti and keep an eye on it (should take about 5-10 minutes to cook) taste it every so often to make sure it's cooked
7.  now stir your meat and vegies, throw some tomato sauce on them stirring them again
8.  Season your meat and vegies with seasoning salt and sprinkly with parsely and oregenal
9.  turn off the stove for meat and vegies
10.  taste your spaghetti, if it's at the texture of your liking (I don't like over cooked pasta) strain it
11.  Rinse your strained spaghetti
12.  cut around 1/4 stick of butter (make sure it's not rock hard/frozen) and mix it around it your strained spaghetti
13.  serve yourself a plate of spaghetti and pour some of the tomato sauce vegies/meat on your spaghetti (as much as you like ^_^)
14.  You're done! eat and enjoy ^_^
 
  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! Remember you can swap any of the meat, vegies seasonings, or types of pasta you use. This is just the combo I normally use when i cook spaghetti and I'm just sharing it :)  I'll probably be trying new stuff in the future and will update this whenever I find something else that I really like, feel free to give suggestions too, would love to hear what you guys come up with! Also for drinks I recommend ice water or lemoniade (fresh squeezed is better)
