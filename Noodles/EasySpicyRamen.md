# Time

* Preparation: 5min
* Cooking: 5-10min

# Ingredients

* 1/2 tsp ginger powder (or 1 tsp chopped ginger)
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder (or 2 cloves chopped garlic
* 1 tsp chili powder (or chili oil)(optional)
* some chopped coriander
* 1 Tbsp of sesame oil
* 2 Tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1/4 beef stock cube (variation: use lamb or ham cube; or veg cube and extra soy)
* 1 or 1/2 frying steak (variation: lamb [legjoint cut or steak] or gammon; or mushrooms)
* 1 bundle of noodles (enough for one person)
* 2 spring onions
* 1 head of pak choi (variations/additions: broccoli heads, cooking spinach, tat soi, or cavolo nero ...)
* 40-50 cL boiling water (approx 1 cup)

# Utensils

* 1 small pot
* 1 frying pan
* 1 chopping knife
* 1 chopping board

# Method

1. Add spices, oil, soy and crumbled stock cube to cold pot
1. Chop up the vegetables coarsley, add to pot
1. Break up the noodles a bit (or not, as you wish) and add to pot
1. Add boiling water to pot and turn on the heat. Water should be just enough to cover a half-inch over the ingredients, though remember that the noodles will absorb some of that. Simmer.
1. Whilst this is simmering, start frying the meat. If beef or lamb, you could try doing it rare â€“ if you dare :-)
    * tip: brown/sear the meat if not already done
1. Once meat is cooked to liking, transfer to chopping board to rest it a couple of minutes
1. Once noodle soup is done, transfer to bowl (noodles should be just about soft / al dente, as you like)
1. Slice meat into small/bite-size strips, and layer on top of noodle soup in bowl
