  <b>Directions</b>
</div>
<ol>
  <li>Throw hot water on stove filling about 3/4 of a small pot, half of a big one (I ususally have the stove at a mediumish setting)</li>
  <li>pour some olive oil (about half a cup) in the pot of water</li>
  <li>while waiting for the water is boiling start up a hot frying pan and spread some butter on it so nothing sticks (I also use medium heat for this too)</li>
  <li>thinly slice up some sausage along with some diced bell peppers, onions and garlic, mix them and throw it on the frying pan</li>
  <li>When done cutting your meat and vegies water should be boiling so now throw some spaghetti into the pot of boling water</li>
  <li>stir the spaghetti and keep an eye on it (should take about 5-10 minutes to cook) taste it every so often to make sure it's cooked</li>
  <li>now stir your meat and vegies, throw some tomato sauce on them stirring them again</li>
  <li>Season your meat and vegies with seasoning salt and sprinkly with parsely and oregenal</li>
  <li>turn off the stove for meat and vegies</li>
  <li>taste your spaghetti, if it's at the texture of your liking (I don't like over cooked pasta) strain it</li>
  <li>Rinse your strained spaghetti</li>
  <li>cut around 1/4 stick of butter (make sure it's not rock hard/frozen) and mix it around it your strained spaghetti</li>
  <li>server yourself a plate of spaghetti and pour some of the tomato sauce vegies/meat on your spaghetti (as much as you like ^_^)</li>
  <li>You're done! eat and enjoy ^_^</li>
</ol>
<p>
  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! Remember you can swap any of the meat, vegies seasonings, or types of pasta you use. This is just the combo I normally use when i cook spaghetti and I'm just sharing it :)  I'll probably be trying new stuff in the future and will update this whenever I find something else that I really like, feel free to give suggestions too, would love to hear what you guys come up with! Also for drinks I recommend ice water or lemoniade (fresh squeezed is better)
