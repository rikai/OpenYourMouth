# Hot Wings

## Hot Sauce
### Ingredients
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 12 oz bottle hot sauce.  Look for Louisiana brand (best) or Frank’s
1 tablespoon white vinegar
Habanero and/or Serrano chilies  (optional)

### Preparation
- Put first three ingredients in saucepan or sauté pan over very low heat until the butter melts for regular degree of heat.
- To get the sauce hotter pour it into a blender once the butter melts.
- Gradually bring the speed up to high (or you’ll have hot sauce on the ceiling) then add a habanero or serrano one at a time.  Let the blender run until the chilies liquefy.
- Taste sauce after the addition of each chili.  When a tear comes to you eye it is hot enough.

## Wings
### Ingredients
Whole or cut wings

### Preparation
Separate the three sections of the wing by cutting through the two joints with a large sharp knife.  If you hit the joint in the center this will be very easy.  The pointy end pieces are useless for eating so freeze them to make stock later or discard them.  You can also get a product from Purdue called “Wingettes”.  These are the two sections of the wing usable for eating.  The tips are not included and the edible sections are already separated.  No cutting.  They also have a lot more meat than regular wings.  These are what I always use.  They are available at Super Fresh and Acme.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and preheat oil to 375 degrees in a large heavy pot or use a deep fryer.  I use a 13 qt porcelain-coated cast iron Dutch oven containing four big cans of Crisco.  Have a thermometer in the oil at all times to monitor the temperature of the oil if possible.  Add wing pieces being careful not to add so many that the temperature of the oil drops too low.  I try to keep it at 340 or higher.  If it goes below 300 you have added way too many.  The trick is to keep the oil temp as close to 360 to 370 as possible.  If the oil temp goes too low, the wings will get oily and greasy.  Cook for about 8 minutes until the sections are golden brown.  The wing sections will float to the top when they re done.   Dry on a rack or paper towels.  

Toss the wings in hot sauce.  Put them on a baking sheet and roast at 350 for 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and brush on a little more sauce.  Serve with celery sticks and Blue cheese dressing.
