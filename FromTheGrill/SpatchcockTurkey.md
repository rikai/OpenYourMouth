# Simple Spatchcock Turkey From The Grill

*Prep Time: 15 min*<br>
*Cook Time: 1.5hrs +/-*


### Ingredients:  
|Ingredients | US    |Metric |
|:-----------|:------|:------|
| Whole Turkey | 12 - 14 lbs | 5.5 - 6 kg |
| Olive oil | 2 tbsp |
* Shaker of poultry seasoning of choice. *Original author prefers Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning.*


### Directions:

1. Remove outer packaging and organ packet from thawed turkey.

2. Place turkey on cutting board, spine up. Take a heavy set of kitchen shears and cut down either side of spine, until spine is completely removed.

3. Flip turkey over and put both hands on center of breastbone, just like you were trying to give turkey CPR. Give a quick, decisive downward press with both arms and you'll hear and feel the breastbone snap. The turkey should now lay almost flat.

4. Coat both sides of turkey with olive oil and poultry seasoning and set aside.

5. Using a chimney starter, start one full chimney of charcoal and let burn until ashes are visible on top layer.

6. Prepare grill by placing a pan of water on one side of charcoal rack (this helps regulate temperature and keep turkey moist), and dump entire chimney of coals against other side of grill, banked tightly as possible against edge of grill. Put a couple of fist sized chunks of hickory on coals and place food grate into position. *Keep in mind, we're using indirect heat, so we're trying to get turkey and coals as far away from each other as possible in our 22" space.*

7. Place turkey on grill; turkey should be skin up, with breast oriented away from coals, and over the pan of water. If turkey legs are protruding directly over charcoal, wrap their ends in pieces of tinfoil to prevent charring.

8. Put lid on grill and do not remove for one hour. 

9. At one hour mark: remove lid, put on a fresh chunk of hickory and install your remote thermometer's probe into the thickest part of the turkey's breast. Set receiver unit to 155 degrees or closest temp underneath that as possible and keep it close to you.

10. At 155 degrees, remove turkey from grill. Allow turkey to rest, undisturbed, for 15 minutes before carving. This will allow turkey to finish coming up to temperature and the juices will redistribute internally.

11. Carve and serve your delicious, moist, smokey turkey. Then listen to everyone rave about how great it is.

### Notes

`Note 1: Original author uses a standard 22" Weber Kettle Grill.`

`Note 2: You do have a remote thermometer, right? If you don't, go get one. Seriously. It's the most important tool in a griller's arsenal when doing indirect grilling, and a cheap one can be had for less than US $30.00.`

`Note 3: You can find recipes all over the internet and various grilling forums that will have you brining the turkey for 24 hours ahead of time, adding coals part way through the cooking process, injecting the turkey with magic potions, etc... none of this is really necessary for a delicious turkey when using this fast, indirect cooking method.`

`Note 4: If you are new to chimney starters take a sheet of 4 paper towels, fold them double and put a 1" wide line of vegetable oil down them. Then fold them into a smallish square and stick under the full chimney starter. Light it off and come back in 25 minutes or so. I've never had this fail to start the chimney. // Alternatively, you can screw around with folded newspaper and frustration, per the instructions that come with the chimney :D`
